      "description": "Spotify jamz is a web application for users to keep a journal of their favorite music in a unique way. Jamz works by asking what song you want to have recorded for that day, it could be a song you just discovered, a song that you rediscovered, or a song that describes how you are feeling that day. The significance of the song is up to the user you can specify the significance with a message to store with the song, on that date. From there it well displays all the music you have listen to in a calendar format for you to go back and view all your entries. Jamz will also include the option to rate and review songs and albums for your own records.",
      "background": "Currently this app is still in the early stages of development and only has a handful of Figma pages and various sketches of how the overall components will interact with each other. I plan to use either React to practice React or Angular to learn Angular with a python backend and a MySQL data base to store users journal entries. Along with this I will be utilizing Spotify API for the music side of the data entry.",
      "purpose": "I used to have this calendar in my room in high school it was a normal Bob Ross calendar, but instead of crossing out the days I wrote a song in every day that passed. Where the only relevance of the song is whatever reason I had for it that day. I found the calendar recently and it was interesting to see all the songs that I had written down. It would have been even more interesting to know the significance of listening to Yellow Submarine Christmas of 2018, but my reasons are now unknown. Along with this I also wanted to keep track of what I think of songs and albums when I listen to them.",
